WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
So hello. Hi.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.800
Hi. My name is Alex

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.500
Seewald. I'm an

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.700
independent perfumer and I'll be

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.200
leading this conversation today.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.800
I'm going to summarize

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.600
some of the facts that

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.900
led to these video being recorded

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.600
and for this conversation to be had.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.800
So we are all gathered here to discuss an

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.800
ongoing concern

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.300
regarding publicly available

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.800
perfumery data.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.900
Which is a very very

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.600
real risk of becoming extinct

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.300
This call is going to be a bit

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.700
formulaic because it's

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.800
essentially a public introduction of the

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.000
problems were facing

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.100
as well as possible solutions that we are not going to

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.900
get too much into the detail of. We are

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.500
mainly going to focus

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.900
on who we are why

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.900
we are interested in preserving perfuming

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.200
data and the problems it

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.300
currently has.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.800
And get the ball rolling really

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.900
so I'd

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.800
like to start with a few facts first

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.700
some unfortunate some

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.500
rather worrying worrying

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.700
that have been discussed on various forums

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.900
like basenotes or on

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.400
Facebook and I keep

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.200
seeing hints of them

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.800
and have turned me down till we had this initial conversation online

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.200
line.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.700
I didn't look into it too much into too much

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.500
detail. But when you start to look at them

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.800
together as it starts to look like

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.800
one big problem in this is what we're talking

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.800
about today. So

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.900
should we start with a big one? They would

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.500
send company so the good sense

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.800
company. So every single performer

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.700
knows this database you will started in

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.900
1980 by I'm sorry

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.900
if I mispronounced your name Bill luebke

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.800
and he made this information

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.300
public 1994.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.300
And the database has grown over time.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.900
He seems to be the only one maintaining that database

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.600
even his wife have gone missing in

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.100
action for a few months. Now,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.400
there are General concerns

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.800
that the database has been updated for a while. I

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.500
believed that the last update was in

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.800
February this year.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.700
I understand some people have been trying to get in touch in

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.800
September with them and no

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.600
contact since as far as I know

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.000
anyway.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.900
So that is the first concern it is one of the biggest

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.500
databases and

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.700
it sounds like nobody's maintaining it

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.500
or whoever is maintaining. It is

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.900
not well or disappear. We don't

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.800
know there's a few other

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.300
sites such as

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.700
the big secret. It is a

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.900
Formula website started by

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.000
gerunds Bala

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.600
and you mentioned on a few forums that

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.300
it was not really interested in maintaining that

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.400
website anymore because

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.400
Is tired of maintaining the website alone.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.700
There's a piece of software called Puffin

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.100
Pro

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.900
developed by the base note user

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.800
wouldn't tobacco which seems dead

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.800
and buried it doesn't to be honest. I haven't

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.600
found any information

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.700
about it, but try to Google a little bit

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.800
nothing. I'm

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.900
also aware that I'm aware that Contraband

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.800
present on this call was on a call with John

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.800
laughing. Well, he's a

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.500
man in his 80s with

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.300
leukemia.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.100
It worked with man's bullet.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.700
Who passed away this year?

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.900
Actually, it's not this year. I made a mistake. Just I have

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.900
to it's in 2010. I misread

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.400
the date. So it's not this here.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.900
Yeah. Yeah. Well, this

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.800
is what we're discussing this or I don't have all the

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.700
information. I'm sure that you get there. We'll

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.900
probably have a fairly accurate representation

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.900
of what's going on. But yeah,

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.500
he's a man. He's the eighties with

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.900
leukemia and the data

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.500
basically what the

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.900
data he owns the data

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.900
to a point of it. I believe that some of the data

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.100
is owned by man's ball.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.100
Owens estate. Yeah,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.600
but that also means that these data is at risk of

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.800
Vanishing. So

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.300
this is the reason we're talking today.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.800
There's a very real fear for the perfumery

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.100
data available to

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.500
Independent amateur perfumers from

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.000
getting extinct

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.700
people present here today are interested in safeguarding these

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.100
data somehow.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.800
We all have our views on how to best accomplish this

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.800
Yeah, and this is what we're going to talk about. So as I

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.400
said before the call is going to be a bit

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.600
formulaic. So I'm going to give

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.400
everyone a

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.200
topic to discuss what it's no

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.800
conversation. We're not going to start asking questions

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.800
and answering because I could go on forever.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.800
We just going to State

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.900
what we feel about each topic.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.900
And and

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.900
hopefully people are watching

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.900
this video will get the gist

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.000
of what we're trying to do.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.800
So I'd like to

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.500
start this call with a few short

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.700
introductions and talking about people's

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.900
backgrounds. And after that we

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.900
talked about everyone's skill sets

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.800
and everyone's fears about the current

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.100
state of perfumey data.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.700
Does that sound

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.900
wonderful? Okay, I would just start

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.000
with what I would also mention.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.700
One thing because I was quite subtle about it.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.300
We will not discuss any possible future

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.900
actions. We're not looking at

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.900
the future what we could do with all that data

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.600
and so on. We're just focusing on

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.400
the topic of preserving that data.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.800
I think I'm open. I'm open to people mentioning ideas of

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.600
what could be done better maybe because that could be a

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.900
concern what I'm going to talk

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.900
about this concerns about the current state

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.600
of the Performing data as well in addition to it becoming

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.200
extinct.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.900
But we're trying not to think

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.700
too far ahead into the future.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.900
So should we start with

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.800
introductions proper introductions?

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.900
What we do in our daily life and how we became

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.100
involved in perfumery.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.400
Should I start? Yeah, we'll put

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.700
most definitely

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.000
and then Contraband last

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.600
so as I mentioned before I'm Alex Seewald,

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.400
I run an independent

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.900
perfumery and cosmetics Company in Manchester

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.900
in the UK by trade.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.800
I'm a software engineer. I used to

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.400
run a medium-sized

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.700
consultancy software consultancy

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.600
until a few years ago. I

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.900
focus on research and development and

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.600
artificial intelligence these days

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.800
anyway in the past. I

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.200
worked with companies like

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.800
L'Oreal and weave it all.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.900
I still like to get my hands dirty so to speak so I

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.400
still develop software on a daily

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.800
basis and these days I

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.000
work in the medical sector

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.800
talking about a bit about perfuming. So I started

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.900
my journey as a perfumer

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.800
that's about five years

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.100
ago.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.700
I started with making cold process

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.900
soap bars because I was curious about the

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.800
chemistry involved and there was a

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.700
bit of a tinkerer

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.900
and then from Subs you start thinking way to be

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.700
nice if they smelled nice.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.100
So as I'm looking at

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.700
fragrances essential oils like everyone

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.700
else and I'm sure that's how we all started

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.200
somehow

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.600
and long story short. I realized I was not going to go

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.500
very very far without Aroma

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.200
chemicals.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.700
I know it's like collecting bottles from Pair

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.300
wall, which is based in the UK

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.400
that you may be aware of

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.600
and got hooked.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.700
So these days I own a

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.300
easily on something like 400

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.700
materials and I keep adding to the palette

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.600
palette every month.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.900
I mainly make bespoke perfumes. Although I do

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.400
sell a couple of fragrances online

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.500
doing turn to expand my business and the range

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.300
in 2021

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.600
depending on what's happening with this pandemic

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.800
and that's me so

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.700
catcher. Tell us about us

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.600
about you. Hello. Hello.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.100
So nice to meet you.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.200
Even during this

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.300
conversation.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.300
Yeah, so I am based in Los

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.200
Angeles. I

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.900
am a man. I

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.500
would say an intermediate level

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.300
perfumer. I've studied

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.900
with it at the institute for Arnold faction for the last couple of

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.600
years, which has been really great

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.100
my interest in perfumery,

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.500
you know, I've been learned so much

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.800
about I love plants. I

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:37.800
love history.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.400
And you know, this has provided a way to

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.400
understand people

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.600
better and our

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.800
history our history and I'm more like kind of

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.600
boy also

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.900
interested in

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.700
like immersive experiences.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.600
So I've been doing some projects with

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.300
VR and just sort of like

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.300
lightweight experimental

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.100
projects.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.900
And so yeah, so I'm just learning I'm learning a lot

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.400
about this. I have a

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.500
small growing library of

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.200
samples.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.500
And

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.800
yeah, and also since May

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.900
there because of the pandemic there's

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.800
been so many perfumers have been able to meet

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.700
each other. So we have a

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.700
small group of sent

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.600
technologists on we have a

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.900
Discord Channel and so

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.900
we're starting to notice, you know, some

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.800
Community around and

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.900
build community around topics

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.600
related to where the scent and

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.000
Technology overlap.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.500
Yeah, so that's kind of my

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.700
Introduction I can talk about the data

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.800
stuff. Oh and professionally, I'm a

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.600
programmer.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.700
I have a background in science

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.100
museum education

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.300
informal science

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.900
and an open

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.900
government. So I'm about to start

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.600
a job that that will be more

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.900
heavily with open data

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.600
and you know public information.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.800
So, yeah, so I also just

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.800
technically I am interested

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.600
and like offering whatever I

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.900
can. Thank you.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.800
And you're going to bunt. Well, I am

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.500
comfortable on from bass notes.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.800
That's where I live.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:21.600
But anyways,

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.900
I'm also a software engineer, but I prefer to

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.800
say programmer to because

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:28.500
actually

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.300
that's what I like about it.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.800
I've always been more comfortable with machines that

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.200
with humans. That's why I say

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.900
programming and since a very early

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.200
age, but

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.900
Professionally, I've been involved mainly

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.700
in the service industry

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.900
mostly financed.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.900
So and it's been focused on

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.500
natural language processing

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.100
within a context of business

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.800
intelligence business Process Management

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.600
and data mining and that sort of stuff

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.100
but I'm retired since

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.800
2016 also,

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.900
and so I wanted to focus on either I

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.900
didn't want to do programming for other

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.800
people. I wanted to start to do

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.600
programming for the home and for

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.700
Or you know and to be you know, so I

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:14.800
started a couple of

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.900
e-commerce businesses. And also I

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.600
was involved in the cryptocurrencies a

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.900
lot which allowed me to

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.100
get into perfumery because perfumery is

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.800
expensive as we know

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.600
and and then I wanted to I said, oh,

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.700
maybe I can also because there's

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.900
nothing going on here in Canada about

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.700
anything about performing

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.900
performing very or Alders are a very

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.600
negative thing and their end.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.700
Which is weird because we are French

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.300
basically and so

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.500
so I thought yeah, why not

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.600
start something that is part

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.900
ingredient and accessories retailer

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.500
and also part.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.800
Well Institute of Art Health action to

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.200
think that because

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.900
they're a big inspiration behind

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.800
what we do for sure. We are true. I

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.700
don't know if we're going to be able to do something

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.900
that is even close

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.800
to what they have been succeeding

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.500
in doing.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.800
I'm in California and in the

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.600
world now, but yeah, so

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.400
that's mainly what

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.900
what I am now and what I'm doing and why

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.300
I'm involved in perfumery.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.400
Okay, thank you.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.900
So unless our next topic and we

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.500
stopped to look at the more

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.100
interesting stuff.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.800
I'd like to talk about the skills that we

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.900
have the could be useful to the

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:38.700
perfume

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.600
conservation project and

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.100
And why we'd like to use them.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.800
I'm I'm going to start but I'm I'm going to try

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.900
not to repeat myself too much because I started an

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:51.900
introduction earlier.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.400
That's I'm overlapping a little bit.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.600
But as far as

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.400
I have knowledge in both perfuming

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.800
being an independent of humor as well

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.200
as being a software engineer.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.900
I've got 20 plus years experience in

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.800
the industry. I run my

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.900
own software.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.800
Something business for about 10 years

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.600
more recently. I've helped build

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.800
database systems apps

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.700
artificial intelligence systems for

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.500
some companies. I think I mentioned it

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.500
before L'Oreal and we beetle.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.700
And these days I apply this knowledge to the medical

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.600
sector. I do fairly

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.300
low-level development around

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.400
databases real-time systems

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.300
data collection and data

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.600
augmentation because that's part of

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.700
what I do in dealing with

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:44.800
artificial intelligence.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.700
So what do I bring to the table?

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.700
Well, first of all, I think because of all

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.900
this I think I'm quite a good

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.400
project manager because I did a lot of

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.700
what I have developed fairly large projects

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.300
for quite big companies.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.900
I can see where we are and where we need

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.800
to be particularly

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.700
concerned consider considering

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.800
perfuming is a very close interest.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.800
And yeah, I don't want to go too much into the each

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.800
skill set because I've got as I say, I've got 20 plus

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.400
years experience. I'm a software

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.900
engineer. I get mine my

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.400
hands dirty. I used to program in

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.800
C++ and assembly back in the day.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.900
It actually intelligence today. I think you can infer the sort of

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:28.700
knowledge I have

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.400
Be on the flip side.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.800
The one

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.800
skill that's important. I think it's because I know about

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.300
performing.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.900
It is very creative. Although it's

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.900
a slow Pursuit and a

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.500
lot of my knowledge comes from personal

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:50.400
experience

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.500
that so many Aroma chemicals available. It's

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.500
impossible to know them all and I

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.900
Rely heavily on data that

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:00.800
is available

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.200
publicly and forums

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.900
again. I'm going to mention it again the goods and companies my main

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.600
source of information like a lot of

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.800
people. That's the reason I'm doing

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.000
this.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:12.500
today

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.900
and yeah, a lot of people rely on this database

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.700
if you watch the spear will be red loss.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.900
So I did things

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.900
like making a full copy

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.700
of TGs using hehd

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.700
track. They don't even know that tall.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.500
So I've got a backup of that database here

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.700
and maintain session was to pass the database to make it more

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.800
useful. We can elaborate on this a bit

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.800
later and there's

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.700
also a lot of dates sources such as the big

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.700
secret which

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:46.800
is I forget his name now was to was started

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:47.000
by

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.500
Groans Fowler which is great

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.900
two gs. He has a handful of them formula. So these are

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.300
examples of data that is

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.700
available that I think again doing something

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.500
interesting with but the

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.600
main and we'll talk again.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.400
I'm going ahead of myself a little bit. But

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.500
I think there's a lot of

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.800
of my skills that can be used to make this

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.800
data more useful clean that

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:12.300
data.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.400
And make it available to people

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.800
and yeah, so I

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.700
think I'm going ahead of myself a little bit.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.900
No, it's yeah Chacha. How

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.800
about you sir? Yeah.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.500
so I think in terms of my

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.200
skills, I

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.900
what I can't what I can offer and you can

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.900
also sort of like what I have time for

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.900
is just

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.900
sort of helping build some Community around

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.500
this. I think that

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:51.500
there's some

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.800
with any kind of you know, this

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.900
sort of, you know, like a vulnerable data project,

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.800
you know, this is a

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.500
unique situation because

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.300
you're trying to locate the

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.800
Person who is maintaining it and that's

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.300
actually something I didn't know

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.100
before this call.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.700
I think you know, it's a shared database do I

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.800
think that there's a lot that is

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.500
important about

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.900
building like starting

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.800
this conversation having

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.800
multiple conversations because

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.500
you know, there's a lot of different sources for the

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.600
data, you know, there's the

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.700
suppliers, you know, who always have the

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.300
most accurate data there's

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.300
peer review.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.900
Assesses that can happen.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.500
So, you know some of my experience

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.700
relating to you know,

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.800
kind of thinking through like some of the community

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.800
needs like that's something I can

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.900
help with and

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.100
creating, you know, some

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.800
sometimes there can be

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.500
a lot of technical expertise which can

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.200
alienate people that are less

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.800
Technical and I enjoy

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.500
creating opportunities

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:06.100
for

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.800
To bring people together to kind of you know,

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.200
look more closely at

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.800
that at what what data even

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.700
is because it's always evolving

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.900
or you know, it's our needs and

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.600
interests very

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.800
so I can bring some sensitivity to

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.500
that area

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.300
and Community Building.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.700
And then you know, it's just as

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.400
a data person. I'm very

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.600
interested in

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.900
like days like understanding like what

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.600
what data is so like flash point, for example, what is

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.300
that? Like, how do we how do we

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.900
Define are the kinds

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.700
of terms that we use

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.800
which are you know, like have been on the Good Sense

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.300
company and I definitely

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.900
have I've been wondering about that

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.800
site because I know that it's

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.300
such an incredible.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.500
credible resource that I mean

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.500
like as as a

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.900
programmer just looking at something that

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.700
was started in the 80s

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.900
that still going isn't so

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.800
incredible and I

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:08.800
hope that

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.600
you know and is the resource that we all use

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.700
and adjust hope that everybody knows

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.800
how how great how

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.700
like important it is and

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.900
because you know, there's so much a perfumery data so

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:23.900
complex and

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:25.200
as your

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.800
like as I've been learning about it, you know, it's

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.900
like I don't really understand every like

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.900
all the aspects of what I'm reading and it's you know,

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.700
it's like over having these resources over a

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.300
long period of time matters,

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.800
even if you get like a perfect

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.700
data set, it doesn't mean that you understand

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:41.900
it, you know.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.800
Yeah, so those are some of the things I can help

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.200
with plastic.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.500
Thank you and Contraband

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.800
well, there will be a bullet point list for

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.900
this and I really

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.400
focused on my current

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.700
usage of the data.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.700
So it's going to be a little bit different from from

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.700
you you two guys, but anyways,

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.900
so I discovered TGs

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:07.600
see-through

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.400
iao in 2016

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.500
when I retired and I was looking.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:13.800
Or something else to do

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.800
and and actually I found

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.900
their open source perfumery or open

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.600
source smell project back, then

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.500
it was already live and it was a

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.700
game-changer for me because it was the

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.700
first time I never saw

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.500
a list of resources anywhere else

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.700
before anywhere else before and that's where I

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.900
discovered perfumers Apprentice the Good Sense

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.300
company every

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.900
perfume supply house and all the other hand.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.000
I know I

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.900
suddenly perfume which was previously

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:42.500
that looked like

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.700
like something like apple secret

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.900
military you get shot if you

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.100
know too much

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.200
turned into something that I could do myself

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:54.700
and I'm a hoarder. So both

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.700
ingredients that I started

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.900
almost ruining my buying them

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.700
and understanding them to gjc

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.500
but I'm also a data hoarder I

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.800
download everything and I keep them in a hard

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.900
drive even though I'm not using them for so

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.900
TJC I downloaded right

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.900
away back for

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:12.500
years ago.

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.900
I didn't make use of it until maybe two

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.100
years ago. When I

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.200
started, you know,

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.600
it was my

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.400
usage is not there to call. It's very

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.700
practical. So at some point I was

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.900
buying gradients and I was realizing where where am

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.800
I going with that? And

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.900
I said, oh maybe I can because I knew

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.700
that there were formulas in

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.800
the Good Sense company database. So I said, oh, well, what if

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.800
I parse the formula and I look

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.900
at what are the ingredients that I use the

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.400
most and I make it and I buy

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.900
a them according to those statistics. So

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:46.800
that was the first usage that I made it

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.800
was immediately practical for me.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.800
So it's not at all, you know

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.500
something it could be a

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.800
theoretical thing. But for me was very practical that I

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.500
needed. I didn't know where to go

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.800
and the Good Sense company

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.800
right away was a tool

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.900
that you know, I use even

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.800
you know, that avoid me probably bankruptcy

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.900
because I would have done anything

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.900
for no reason and sorry. I'm spitting in my

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:12.400
microphone.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.800
And so then the next

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.700
step was that I was interested

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.900
in the relationship between physical

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.200
and chemical properties and

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.500
organoleptic properties and I will explain our

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.600
genetics because maybe it's a big word but

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.800
basically just means how it

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.400
appears to senses. So

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.700
does it smell like mint or does it smell

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:34.300
like

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:37.900
anything and the tags that the good

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.900
sense company actually are using so basically

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.800
our their relationships between

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:42.400
the

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.900
an elliptic tags in the sense that our

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.900
how it smells to a human brain

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.700
and and the chemical and the physical data.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.500
So so

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:52.200
basically

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.300
clustering normal cross ring and

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.900
normal regression

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.300
on the data between the two

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.800
to find patterns and everything and I

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.800
did find patterns contrary to some

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.900
people that say that it's useless and it

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:07.800
doesn't make sense for

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.100
yeah, and so

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.700
next thing was that

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.500
I wanted to maybe

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.800
even that the next step for me is that

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.200
I wanted to predict the

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.700
organoleptic of a formula and not just a single

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.700
ingredient which is basically what we're

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.600
trying to reach when you want the

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.900
computer to help you

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.400
composing a perfume and making a

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.400
formula and so

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.400
I've stated work on that too.

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.300
There is

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:37.100
also a

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.000
constraint based

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.900
formula composition also that

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:42.300
you say

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.700
You know, I wanted to see I want those

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.900
tags those tags those tags and so it gives

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:48.900
suggestions and it's very crude. You

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:50.900
know, I don't have user interface.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.800
It's only I modify the parameters in the code and address

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.900
run it so it's not there's

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:57.600
no user interface for anything. But

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.900
I have my own,

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.400
you know perfume

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.800
composition software that is running now,

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.000
and I'm using and

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.200
that doesn't mean that it smells good what

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.700
but anyway, so and recently

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:12.100
more

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.800
Be like a couple of months ago or a couple of

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.700
weeks ago. You catch her I

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.700
made is a series of video on YouTube. And

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.200
actually there are posted on the

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.200
iao website

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.800
alongside their own series of video that they

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.400
made during the pandemic

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.700
and it was about is

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.700
vibration theory of smell. So I

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.100
heard about that theory

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.900
a long time ago, but of course it didn't make sense to me and people were

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.900
fighting over it on Basil's and I couldn't

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.400
understand anything and you made it very

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.900
Very clear. Actually this series to

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.900
me is a must you have to listen to it.

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:48.000
If a if

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.800
it's look

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.700
for Lucas Ryan on YouTube and he

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.700
only has those thing and actually their

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.800
list there. They're listed on the

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.800
iao website on

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.700
in their video section or something

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.700
and it before but I've never actually listen to it.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.900
Okay. Yeah, so it's

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:09.500
very interesting. And

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.900
so what I got out

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:12.400
of it is that

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.700
Was the first time that I heard the

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.700
because there are many theories of

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.800
smells that are competing and

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.800
fiercely and

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.800
and it almost religiously

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.700
at times but for me the

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.800
vibration theory of smell is the first one

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.900
that offered a path from

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.600
the physical data to the

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.900
organoleptic data in a way that was not just

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:37.100
my you know,

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.800
random clustering and things that I could do

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.800
with well, you know random

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:42.200
wrist.

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.600
basically, so it offered a model that said,

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:45.900
okay we

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.400
It seems like the smells were

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.400
scepters are able to dictate

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.700
functional groups in a

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.800
molecule. Like it's

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.900
an aldehyde or it's you know,

00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.600
a ketone or something like that.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.600
So I said, oh we didn't be nice

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.400
because you have a

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.900
Smiles representation on TGs CI Smiles

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.200
representation basically is the

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.800
chemical representation is the string

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.800
of atoms basically that there

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.600
is in the molecule and it you can

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.900
extract basically the structure

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.200
of it. So one of the

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.900
Is that is in the structure are the functional groups

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.800
you can tell from the smiles

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.700
representation whether or not it's a

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:25.600
ketone or an aldehyde or

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.400
anything like that. So that was the

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.500
first thing that I try to do

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.600
and unfortunately, I

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.900
posted that on bass notes

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:35.600
and I got some

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.900
peopled and because they were angry at

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:39.800
me that I am anyways,

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.600
but anyways, it's working and it

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.700
works and it makes sense

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.100
now, so

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.200
so yeah, and I know

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.700
other thing that I did recently was that

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.800
I found out that of course on

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.300
TJ's seed are much more

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.900
ingredients than you can find at,

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.900
you know, the usual retailers. So I made a list of

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.700
all those ingredients that I called

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.900
rare to find because I couldn't

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:04.900
find them and I

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:06.700
post also posted that down on bass

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.900
notes to say. Oh maybe we can do group

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.800
buys for the things that you know that

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.900
are and and I also talked

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:14.500
to Kristin at

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.900
perfumer supply house and she was willing to say, oh

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:17.100
well

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.600
Via if there is a that minimum of

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.900
people that are going to buy that

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.600
minimal quantity that I'm willing

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.900
to make an offer for

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:27.700
that ingredient. So I posted that

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.000
online and nobody

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.700
used it except Paul Kyler we

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.700
tested it but then later I found out that he

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.700
doesn't need it because if he wants he can buy a

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.900
kilo of anything because he's in the

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.800
business and he has

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.700
He can maintain an inventory and it's no problem for

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.400
him. But for people that just want to

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.800
smell samples. I

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.600
thought that it was a good idea, but

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:50.500
apparently

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.900
nobody's using it. But anyways, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.800
because then I'm going to use it for my

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.900
clients and I will make use of it

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.800
eventually. It's just that

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.500
I find that there's a

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.800
generational gap between

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.600
the previous

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.800
generation of artists and or a

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:10.600
dependent perfume.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.500
that are not at

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.300
all data

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.700
based or even

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.900
averse to technology and general and

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:21.400
a new generation

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.800
that will I think I'm part of and

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.500
that you are part of that are

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.100
more inclined

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.900
toward including technology in

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:30.900
perfumery engine

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.600
specifically and but I think that it

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.700
creates conflict sometimes

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.900
and and I don't like conflicts like

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:39.800
that and

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.600
so so so I found a lot of

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.900
reluctance through, you know, I always

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:46.700
try to post my things on bass

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.800
notes, but it's you know, there's a

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.600
lot of resistance on

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.900
this. So that's why to me it

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.500
adds to the problem that

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.900
I think that if we

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.400
don't do something the

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.700
community as it stands right now will

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:02.700
probably let it die, you

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.600
know because they're not that

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.900
much into Data so much as we

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:07.500
are now

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.500
so and to to finish

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.600
So my main interest now is the

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.600
is to find an order space

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.800
topology like because we have

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.600
a form of order space for

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.700
vision for example, RGB or all

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.900
familiar with you know, red green and

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.600
blue forms a space that

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.600
represents how we see things

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.900
and there's the same thing for audio but

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.800
there's no such things for

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.800
odors. So one of the things that we

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.900
cannot do right now is to create a

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.100
distance between

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.600
organoleptic distance with are similar.

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:42.800
There are two

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.900
different ingredients to the human nose.

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.700
We cannot do that formerly right

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.700
now, but I

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.800
talked to personally to look at certain

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.700
about it. And he said well his

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.900
estimate because I asked them what do you think is

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:56.700
the dimensionality of this other

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:58.700
space that is speculative right now, and he

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.700
said it's it

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:02.900
seems to him that it's about

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:04.500
10 10 D.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.200
Basically, like for example, the

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:08.700
RGB is 3D audio is

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:10.600
2D it's time and amplitude.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.600
But the other smell

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:13.400
would be

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.900
10 D. And the thing with that is

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:17.900
that it makes it

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.900
non-trivial to form

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:22.700
a distance notion because I know the

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:24.900
distance in 10d doesn't

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:26.700
is not intuitive for humans,

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.100
but it would

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.900
explain why some aldehydes

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:32.200
for example have

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.500
our ad seemingly, no nothing in common.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.000
Organelle a plea sorry

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.300
the way they smell certain things.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.700
I will drink just once

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.900
but anyway, so the other space

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:50.800
thing is my my

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:51.400
main

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.700
focus right now and I'm heavily

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.800
focused on that and and

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.500
then secondly the distance

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.800
between 2 2 molecule

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.800
in that other space. So

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.700
that's something that I think I took too much

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:06.700
time, but I felt it from

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:07.300
Alex.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.600
Yeah, you could see me the fidgets English.

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:11.400
Yeah,

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.800
I think that's very interesting. I think you're making a good point, which

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.700
is probably should be the subject of

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:19.800
another call. Actually. I think it's very interesting is the

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.000
difference between

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.300
perfume years art.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.800
Or and perfumery as a science

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.500
and I think that things are Blended

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.700
or is there a difference to me?

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:33.600
There's no difference personally. They actually

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.300
I think it's a very interesting subject

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:42.900
and I have discussed in sorry. I'm just opening your bracket.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.100
I'm going to close it in second.

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.900
I think it's very interesting that what you're suggesting in

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:50.800
terms of ten Dimensions, or actually I

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.900
would say there's at least 30 dimensions in

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:53.700
terms of smells.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.400
It's something that you do instinctively as a

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.900
perfumer, you know, all I want this to be

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.600
considered Dimension being Citrus a

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.600
dimension being Adam

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.800
indoor things like that. So you could

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.600
in your mind as a perfumer you can sort of

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:11.900
see it. But how do you do it with

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.900
pure data? It's how do you

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.900
tell a computer to do this? Very

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.700
very interesting, but

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.100
it's not a discussion for today.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:22.400
So

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:35.500
The data shows that

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.400
the data is very important.

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.800
So because it's so important nice

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:48.200
segue

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:50.500
nice segue.

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.200
It needs to be I think we all do

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.600
They need to be preserved

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.800
and I would

00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.400
like to talk about our own

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.900
perspectives and Impressions on the current

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:03.500
situation that I've highlighted

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.900
earlier and that judge on Contraband

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.600
have discussed as well.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.900
So this is the time to actually dig into it and talk

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:11.700
about it.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.500
So I guess I'll start

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.900
but I've I've already stated

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:20.600
my current concerns in the

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.900
introduction earlier because these are very

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.200
valid very serious.

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.600
Curtains maybe not to big

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.800
companies like iff and people don't have their own

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.600
database as I believe

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.800
Contraband as mentioned earlier with charcoal

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:33.000
burner,

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.500
but however, two independent

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.900
perfumers. Our people are just

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:43.000
learning beginners

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.800
days. It's not very perfume. He's

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:48.600
not very accessible. It's difficult to get

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.900
into it's expensive again as

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:51.900
Contraband said earlier.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.600
so this data is

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.900
really really not only useful but it's

00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.700
also vital and I know that you

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:01.700
mentioned poor Kyle earlier, but I know that you

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.900
mentioned before these using GSC 20 times

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:05.700
a day, you know, even if you're

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.800
even if you're independent perfume or even if you're bigger, you still

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.900
use it so

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:14.800
I do

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:18.900
have a lot of concerns with the current state of the

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:20.700
data that I would

00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:22.900
like to address. The first one

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.900
is obviously it's at risk of Disappearing which

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.100
we discussed just then

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:27.800
at length I think

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.600
so to try to make but reassure

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.600
myself. I made a copy of TGs see such

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:37.800
as Contraband did and I'm sure a lot of people

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.800
have done the same but

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.800
these data is either out of date

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:42.300
or

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.500
It will never evolve you will never be

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.500
updated.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.700
These data is made

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:52.800
of a lot of his gml files as a

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.700
minute and I'm sure there's a database

00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:56.900
behind it again. I'm talking about the TGs

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:58.600
see specifically because that's the main

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.800
one, but that's true of a locked up a

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.900
lot of our other websites and

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.800
databases, but that's a lot of issue

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.100
ml files and I think

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.900
what should be done and I'm not going to go too far

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.900
into the future, but I think he needs to be passed. I think you

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:12.700
need to be cleaned.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.700
And may be made available to the public even if it's

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.500
just and I think there's something I just got to

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.800
contraband offline, but

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:22.900
we should make it available to

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:24.600
the public. Even if it's a real copy

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.400
of the data as it is now

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.800
if Jesse were to go down today.

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.900
What do we do you know, so as he's having a

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.800
copy of it would be a good start to

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.600
beat a very very

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:41.400
very short term solution. It's not really a solution

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:44.700
and there's a few problems that this

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:46.900
brings. There's a question about permissions.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.700
Do we have the right to copy that

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.600
data? Do we have the right to make it

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:52.700
publicly available?

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.900
So that's one of the concerns I have

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:57.800
and I think that we need to get permissions

00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.900
from from Bill.

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:02.900
Counterfeit ecsc and from the

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:04.800
others from the other websites. I mentioned

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:05.300
earlier.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.600
I think that once we have

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.300
permission, I think the data should always be

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.300
copyable. You should have duplicatable.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.700
You should people should be able to

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:16.700
download it as it is

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:18.800
and

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.600
in terms of permissions if the but

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.500
I can explain this

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.500
because there's no Central Point at the minutes

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.400
for directing what happens to

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.900
that data. There's no Central

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.900
database though. There's no organic. There's

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:37.900
no company.

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:39.400
There's no organization in the

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.800
world. As far as I know. They

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.900
centralizing

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.800
that one database of armor

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.800
chemicals essential oils and so

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.800
on for everyone

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:50.400
to access

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.700
There's TGs. He became one

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.400
that is the de facto one,

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.600
but there's no real

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.900
organization a bit like Wikipedia. I'm

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:02.700
thinking of Wikipedia there

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.500
would make that data available

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.600
publicly everyone could contribute to

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.900
it and ensure that the

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.300
data is always updated

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:12.700
and that's one of my my concern

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:13.000
so

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.000
my

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.900
It's not really a solution. But the way I see it. I think the

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:20.800
data should be the

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.900
permission permission for that date. I

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:24.900
want to solve and obtained.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:27.500
Hopefully we do obtain them if we don't obtain them it's a different

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.400
problem. But if we do

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.900
I think in my mind creating a

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:34.600
foundation or not for profit

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:36.900
profit organization a bit like the Eye-Fi

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.500
far a bit like Wikipedia.

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:40.900
Would be useful.

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:44.700
And they would direct what happens that

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:46.600
data, but the sole purpose and so

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.900
mission of that organization would be to make

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:50.700
the data publicly available and those

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.400
license these freely

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.900
very permissible. I think

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.700
Contraband mentioned before Creative

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.500
Commons. I think that's a really good idea

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.900
and there are other types of licenses, but the intention here is to

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:07.700
have an orgasm

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.800
that will an organization that

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.100
will keep the data public

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:15.700
that another concern I have and it's

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:17.900
always all right. Is it a lot of Iran permissions over I

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:19.900
think we'll find that the problem around data is

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:21.700
always permissions are the source of the data

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.900
because we don't know where it comes from and I

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:26.700
think because the sauce is own clear with t

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.900
with t GSC. I'm guessing some

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:30.400
of it comes from iff. She will die

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.800
excetera because you've got that logos

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:34.900
on the front page and the streaming the

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.800
contribute to the database. I don't know how they

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.100
contribute to teach

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:40.200
So you both Zoom the contributes

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:43.900
data. I don't think the

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:45.800
contribute money unless unless just having to

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.800
log on the front pages enough to justify

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.900
paying big so many to maintain the website book Running a

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:52.200
website just cost along money.

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.600
But yeah, the sauces are in clear

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.900
and I feel their maintenance Paramount. So

00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:59.900
if we were looking at a model

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:00.800
like Wikipedia

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.900
and letting people contribute data to it, I think we

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:06.800
should know who contributed what data

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:07.700
so you can have

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.500
a certain guarantees that the data is accurate.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.900
So if you look at another profile for new are mechanical

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:15.600
that nobody's ever seen before because

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:17.100
you know, he was a captive

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.700
if it came if it's Geodon captive and she would only

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.700
contribute to the data. I'll be quite happy with it. He

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:25.500
was just somebody who's unknowns was

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.900
posited one thing and say, oh it smells like it

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.800
smells like citrus. I don't know

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.900
that's true, you know, so I think there's

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:33.800
an importance about knowing what the data

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.900
source is and maintaining

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:36.100
it.

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:38.100
It's

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:40.900
All the same night as I was saying before long a long permissions

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.900
and where the data is from. I think that

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:44.600
needs to be controlled to a

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:45.100
point.

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.600
And then making the data available to the rest of the world really

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.300
through simple download of her.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.800
The database will be downloaded as a zip file. It could be

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.900
through an API. It could be for a web

00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:58.900
front end but keep

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:00.800
track of the sources and contributions. I

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.800
think we can pedia is a good model except for

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.700
the one thing that bothers me. Is

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.600
anyone can watch for Wikipedia.

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:10.700
We need to control how data is

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.400
contributed to the database and

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.500
updated dgse hasn't been

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:16.700
updated since February. I think I mentioned earlier

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.900
and I think that it does a few

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:21.700
mistakes you can see them all the time, but

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:23.800
you kind of know it's wrong but you can see a

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.600
lot of mistakes because lots of materials are

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.700
similar lots of images of cats similar

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:29.500
cast members and so on.

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:32.900
So I think having this way of

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.700
letting people contribute to the database directly

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.700
is definitely the direction I would like to

00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:40.700
I see it being solved that problem being solved.

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.900
So from a technical point of view have to mention a SQL database.

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:45.800
I'd be happy with the SQL database doesn't matter

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:47.600
as which is a database

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.900
again Contraband mention Abdi be in the past which is a

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.600
distributed database system,

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.900
which allows copies everywhere. I personally

00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:58.800
have concerns we doing that because you

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.900
could duplicate the data you can have

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:02.800
different copies of different versions of the data flying

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.800
around I would be more

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.800
comfortable having a centralized

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:07.800
database they've ripped

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.800
Dated so this is one but another

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.900
concern you can't I don't want to have Devon

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:14.900
dominating their own database iff making

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:16.700
their own database unless the sharing of the data.

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:20.500
And that's it really

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.700
in terms of concerns. My concerns were obviously I liked in the

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.600
introduction earlier. These are my more

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.100
specific technical concerns.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.800
And I think the first step is

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.800
to grab copy of TGs see and

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.000
figure out how to

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.900
preserve it and how to make it available

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:37.600
to the world.

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.400
And then we can you can already infer the

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.900
possibilities of Beyond a simple cleaning and

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:45.000
mirroring of the data

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.400
but private preserving. The data is the Paramount

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.400
priority. Really

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:53.500
that's it. That's my view

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:56.600
judge them for Bunkie.

00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:58.200
Yeah.

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:02.300
Yeah, so I

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:06.100
permission issues really

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:08.800
interesting. I as somebody

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.600
who is not on bass

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:12.900
notes very often and

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.300
I'm still I'm still learning

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.900
but I would I am and I

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:20.700
don't know that I would

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.600
be I feel like

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.400
because it you know perfumery is a

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.800
small community. I think, you know

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.700
just sort of doing an

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:30.500
inventory of who

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.900
Who may already know these

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:34.500
people and maybe I may have had these

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:36.900
conversations before can be

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:38.900
really important. But

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:40.700
you know, it's like we're waving a

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:42.500
red flag here

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:44.000
and signaling and so

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.500
some people because just

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
so yeah, I'm not going to interrupt you, but

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.900
they quickly as I mentioned before for

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:53.600
example to JSC was

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.800
created by for graft site

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:58.800
bill. I was forget his name.

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.400
Look a syllabic. Yeah.

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.800
Okay, I don't know how to pronounce it. So I'm sorry if I

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:03.500
mispronounced it

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:07.600
and he's the one who solely

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.800
maintain the database as far as we know

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:12.900
but we don't know what the data source is.

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:13.600
I just want to go

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.500
signal this signal that we're doing right now may

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.700
help solve that

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:29.300
problem.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.600
If I guess I'll just put it out there. If

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.800
anybody knows, please please reach

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:35.500
out

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.900
particularly for you and my when I

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:40.900
will in spite of to talk, I have

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:43.200
Scoops. Okay, okay

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:46.900
plot twists suspense. I can't wait to

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.800
get to that in

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.800
terms of you know,

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.400
kind of properly Community

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.600
process. I think that

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:56.900
it's very possible because this

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.700
is a pain a pain point for

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.600
perfumers for a long.

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.900
Time I feel like there's there's going to be a lot

00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:04.700
of energy of people

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:07.900
seeing seeing this same thing and having

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:09.600
really similar interests. So

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000
some models that could also

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.900
work into this process. I like

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:16.700
like what you were mentioning about, you know

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.400
coming up with some sort of

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.300
foundation or you know, like,

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:23.800
you know some Community a community group that is

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.600
able to Steward the

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:27.600
data. You don't have

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.600
develop a you know some goal line.

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:31.700
Shared goals.

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:34.000
I

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.600
think that in reaching out to

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.000
whoever

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.800
the permissions that

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.800
need to be obtained from sort of

00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:43.800
organizing that kind of

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.300
that

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:48.700
kind of mission or that at intention

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:50.900
could be really helpful, you know, just

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:52.800
sort of to form a relationship.

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:54.900
I think that there's so

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:56.700
many possible partners

00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:58.600
for for this and

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.700
that eventually like I could see

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:02.900
he's having some sort of like Town Hall,

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:05.900
you know, maybe in a few months where you

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:07.600
know people that have interest

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:09.400
can can come and

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.600
participate even you know you

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:14.700
for data that's

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:16.800
coming say from like a fragrance

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.800
house like they're going that's you know,

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:20.800
they're always going to be the best source

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.300
of their like say their precise chemical

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.500
information and so

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.700
forming relationships in that

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:29.600
way it

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:30.600
but I think you know,

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.900
Just like also acknowledging

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:34.400
what's come before is really

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:36.700
important. And you know, I'm sure that everybody

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:38.800
in those situations has their

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.500
own deep feelings

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:42.700
about this and so just making sure

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:43.600
that there's

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:46.700
room to communicate,

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:48.800
you know, as we're starting with

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.800
that and the same thing, you know, like what if for data

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.800
just ensuring that that

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.700
data is correct and accurate because

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:56.800
though you know for me that those are

00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.900
like those values are the ones that I am

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:00.600
using for my own safety.

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:02.900
ft and you just took

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:04.700
to make sure that whatever

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.800
is like the formula is that I'm making are not

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:08.900
actually poisonous

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:12.900
which sometimes they've got clothes

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:14.000
so

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:18.800
Yeah, so I like I like the general direction

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.800
of what you're talking about. And I think you know just

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:21.300
sort of

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:24.900
making sure that there's a good structure

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:26.900
for Community participation

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:28.900
is going to be really important and

00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:30.200
also, you know, like there may be a

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:32.900
proliferation of databases, you

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:34.900
know, there may be some shared one, but there may

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:36.900
be like others to which is a great

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:38.500
thing to have. You know, it's just like

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:41.000
you have like, you know,

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:44.300
you'll be able to have this some

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:45.700
opinions over time.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.800
And you don't have just like that one One Source you

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.900
have you may have like wrong a few and

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:52.900
so the these

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:54.800
kind of like having only

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:56.600
one thing that's really vulnerable will

00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.700
be not as much of an issue.

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:01.600
Okay. Thank you.

00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:05.900
And what just come to months take on the

00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:08.900
problem. Well, I think

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:10.600
I'm gonna just grab a water a little

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:12.900
bit make you

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:14.200
wait. All right,

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:20.900
so well again, it's going to be a

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:22.800
little bit different than your

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.200
two interventions because

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:26.700
basically I have been the one,

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:29.500
you know, having those

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:31.800
conversation and then making

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:32.600
this realization.

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.800
That it was necessary because

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.900
of events that happened actually in my

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:38.800
life or in the forums that I

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.700
was I was a witness

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:42.900
of and so the first thing that started

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:44.800
for me is that many reference books

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:47.800
have gone out of print and

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.800
I have not even been digitized and are not

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.500
offered on the internet

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.800
archives freely or

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.400
are not because the new Avenue

00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:59.900
Library service that you can download things for

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:01.500
24 hours and then they have

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:02.500
drms now.

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:04.500
On some of those things, but it

00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:06.900
some of some books are not even available

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:09.700
like that. And Google

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:11.700
Books is evil it will

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:13.400
only let you see the table of

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:15.600
contents and the parts that they choose

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:17.900
anyways, there are lots of it started for me

00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:20.700
with reference books that people were mentioning on bass

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:22.900
notes and and other places and

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:24.800
especially Paul Keller with his famous

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:26.500
for that say no I have it

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.900
it cost me like $2,000 to get

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:30.800
that single copy. It's the only one

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.600
left in the world I can.

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:34.900
If you're really nice with me

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:36.500
make some copies of the

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:38.600
pages, but the two

00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:40.900
that that was the first trigger for me.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.800
I was triggered by that and I'm not saying that

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:45.800
both Keller is is evil

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.300
he does what he can and he's you know,

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:50.900
he's also a answering a lot

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:52.900
of questions to the community on

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:54.600
bezels. Nino is really present is

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:57.400
really a community organizer. But he has

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.900
this is who corrects and some of them is that he's proud

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:02.500
of some

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:04.400
exclusive knowledge that are

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.500
exclusive access that he has to some

00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:08.900
knowledge. And so the

00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:10.400
other thing was that

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.900
before bass notes and before

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:14.700
all of those things there was a

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.700
perfume making Yahoo groups and there are

00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:20.500
groups is closing on

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:23.600
December 15 of this year. I know

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:25.600
that the original perfume

00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:27.600
making Group which for

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:29.800
example Tower the guy

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.600
who does the tower and of

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.400
aggregate is foreign.

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:34.600
First Lane, but if you know

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:36.900
last time I ever came and

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:38.900
everything it was he started

00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:40.600
making perfumes on that

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:44.700
on that mailing list. And so this

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:46.600
mailing list is going away. They have made a

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:48.800
copy and they are now on another

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:50.800
mailing list system, but there's a couple of

00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:52.600
other perfumery

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:54.700
related mailing list that are still on

00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:56.800
Yahoo groups that will die and

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.800
December of this year if they're

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.400
not scraped the for that

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:02.500
and one of them that I'm

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:04.700
Really interested in is the one that was

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:06.700
related to ancient formulas and

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:08.800
ancient will is a necessary,

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:12.800
you know, that would be kind of ironic

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:14.900
that the history mailing list

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:16.500
is going away. First

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:19.600
forever. It's gonna yeah.

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.500
So also when your whole

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:23.200
civilization being

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:25.700
basically white tough, yeah,

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:27.900
and and so many blogs are

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:29.400
also disappearing because

00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:31.700
maybe maybe it's I

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:32.300
would say

00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:34.900
Years ago, but it's more like 20 years

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:36.900
ago in the blog era and

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.800
WordPress and movable

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.800
type. I don't know if you're old enough to

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:42.300
remember that but

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:45.400
I'm not that hold by the way, don't say that.

00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:47.900
But yeah, so a lot

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:49.800
of those bloggers were hired

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:50.900
by other

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:53.700
entities and the perfume world

00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:55.700
and even in

00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:57.600
Vivo de or iff,

00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:59.600
and they were forced to close their

00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:00.200
blogs

00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:02.500
so that

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:04.800
And a lot to people people

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.800
are also deleting their own post

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:08.700
on Basil's because the rage

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:10.700
quit base notes very

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.700
often and people that have contributed a

00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:13.200
lot,

00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:17.800
you know, and then earlier this year

00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:19.500
because I was scraping the Good Sense

00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:21.300
company. I realized that it was not

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:23.700
updated based on the time stamps of the

00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:25.300
files. I realized that the

00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.800
precise date that it was last updated was

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:29.800
February 24th. There's

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:31.700
no other update after that

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:32.500
and I looked

00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:34.700
The x times I looked at the site map

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.600
and I feel like it's you

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:39.500
know, I don't know a four-hour long it

00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:41.700
anyways, so that was a problem to me. And

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:43.700
then in September of this year

00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:44.900
Paul Kyler again

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:48.800
posted a message saying that it was not able to

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:50.700
reach Bill and Linda

00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:52.700
which are the which is a couple that is

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:54.700
maintaining. Well, it's mostly bill I think

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:56.900
but they are maintaining the Good

00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:58.500
Sense company database and he

00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:00.700
said, oh maybe we should send them

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:02.400
wish, you know.

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.800
Wish you well cards and stuff and

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.700
then and then

00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:07.100
so.

00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:12.700
Well, the main plot twist is I talked to Paul

00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:14.100
Kyler yesterday on the phone

00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:16.700
and because I wanted to ask him

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.800
did you hear news? It's I September and

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.800
said no, I was like, oh my God,

00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:22.100
this is the

00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:24.800
sorrowful and but and

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.900
but he told me don't contact them yet. I will

00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:30.800
try to to to contact them

00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:32.800
again because he has been in touch

00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:34.700
with them. So I didn't want

00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:36.900
to bypass him and and just go

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:38.900
ahead and so he said and don't contact

00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:39.200
him.

00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:42.900
Them. Well Polly is going to try

00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:44.800
to contact them. And basically that's what I mean. You

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:46.900
don't want 10,000 perfumers around the world

00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:48.900
trying to come to yeah, look the same because yeah,

00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:50.900
I think it's gonna do you make things worst

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:53.600
Really Gonna want to run away with

00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:55.600
it and and but

00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:57.600
basically, yeah,

00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:59.400
so that also happen

00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:01.600
everything happened on bass notes basically

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:03.200
and so the other thing

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.900
you ever once parlor also posted on bass notes that he

00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:08.700
was tired maintaining his formula

00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:09.300
website.

00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:11.900
Right and then later, I was having

00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:13.200
a conversation with

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:15.700
people including Paul Keller

00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:17.600
about missile did Raja

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.900
Jasmine at which is more known as

00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:21.500
it's your own and

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:23.700
so we were trying to figure out

00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:26.700
what were the islamists in the

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:29.800
how do you say that in English? Please? Let me know how to

00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:31.800
pronounce it correctly is isomers.

00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:33.700
Whereas on Earth eyes omers. Yes,

00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:36.200
so isomers in in the

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:39.300
in the various Indian.

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:41.600
X and I realized that that

00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:43.800
information was not even on TGs see why

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.900
it's important because so 40 GS see

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:47.700
anything that is missile. Did Russia is

00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:49.600
not is one thing and

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:51.500
so so

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:53.300
there is not even a listing of the

00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:55.900
different isomers

00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:57.800
and there's not even a listing of the

00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:00.700
theoretically desirable sis

00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:03.900
isomer that is but that is one

00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:05.800
of probably eight or more

00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:07.900
isomers that are in the

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:09.300
Middle Ages.

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:11.400
Man admixtures so that

00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.700
prompted Paul Keller to say well

00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:15.900
or something somebody else said, well, you

00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:17.500
should look at laughing Wells

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:19.500
Associates, which is another

00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:21.700
database. It's not free. It's actually quite

00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:23.800
expensive, but they

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:25.700
probably have some information on

00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:27.900
that and Paul Keller said you should call

00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:29.900
it indirectly, you know, he likes to

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:31.600
talk and I think so

00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:33.600
so I called him to

00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.700
and that's when he told me that

00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:37.700
he was 80 something

00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:39.300
and I will

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:41.800
Dealing with leukemia right now. I'm

00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:43.900
laughing. But okay, please I'm not laughing about

00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:45.900
it. Like I was like, oh this is

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:47.900
bad news upon bad news upon bad

00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:49.700
news everything closeness and

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:51.700
the seriousness of the situation. Yes

00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:53.700
y-yes, so but to be

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:55.800
honest so and that was the purpose of

00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:57.900
this video to make it clear that I'm not

00:54:57.900 --> 00:54:59.600
I don't think I'm hallucinating

00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.500
anything, you know, and

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:02.300
I

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:05.800
He told me that he

00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:07.100
used to work with another

00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:09.800
partner that died in 2010.

00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:11.400
Like he Alex

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:13.800
mentioned, but he is

00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:15.900
also sending

00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:17.900
money to the this partner

00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:19.700
this dead Partners family

00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:22.200
because they actually basically

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:24.400
merge his database with

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.900
John laughing Wheels database and that made the current product that

00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:29.500
it is right now, so it's already a

00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:31.800
licensing mess and I

00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:33.300
said well, let me

00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:35.700
I think about it and maybe

00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:37.500
that's why I said

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.900
well, I won't I need to talk about other

00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:41.800
people and see if there's interest

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.900
about all those things and are

00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:45.900
you interested that I call you back in

00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:47.300
a couple of weeks or something?

00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:49.700
And he said yes, so so that's

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:51.800
the state of the things but I think it's going to

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:53.900
be a lot of talking to those

00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:55.900
owners of the

00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:57.700
data and well,

00:55:57.700 --> 00:55:59.300
you know

00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:01.900
because in the meantime the big

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:03.100
Aroma chemical

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:05.900
knees are multiplying the announcements that

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:07.800
they are working with AI and

00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:09.800
big data in their companies and they're

00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:11.900
doing it in a proprietary way that is

00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:13.700
closed that is not accessible to us.

00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:15.800
And I have a feeling that if we're not doing

00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:17.700
anything, we're not going to be

00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:19.900
able to maintain artisanal

00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:21.900
perform very competitive with

00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:24.900
the big companies because we don't have access to

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:26.600
this data and they do and

00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:28.500
they are telling us we well

00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.400
we have it. We're not giving it to you

00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:33.200
and anyways

00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:35.800
I just want to

00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:37.900
mention because it was a topic

00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:39.400
that I'm against

00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:41.500
centralization in any

00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:43.700
form. And to me

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:46.800
the thing that needs to be done is

00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:48.900
just to make a dump of the data with

00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:50.400
a permissive license

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.500
and to ask the original owners of the

00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:55.500
data if they

00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:57.900
agree with that and if they don't answer

00:56:57.900 --> 00:56:59.800
there still something we have to do

00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:01.700
about it. That's my point of

00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:03.200
view grid and

00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:05.800
and it's just a dump of the data as it

00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:07.600
is with its, you know

00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:09.500
with its inaccuracies with

00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:11.900
anything as it is right now and then we can

00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:13.300
start making something else

00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:15.500
afterwards because

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.800
yeah, so because I'm a

00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:20.900
I'm I have always been a

00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:22.400
hacker. It's more like

00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:24.800
download first and then talk

00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:26.600
later or license later.

00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:28.900
So I have it already in

00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:30.900
my in well

00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:33.100
in my hard drives and everything, but

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:35.400
I think that to feel good

00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:37.700
about it. If I want to do something

00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:39.600
commercially, I needed to be license

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:41.900
differently. That's my point of view and

00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:43.400
also to be able to

00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:46.800
to exist somewhere that I can download it instead of

00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:48.900
just scraping it like, you know,

00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:50.100
black hat hacker again,

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:52.700
so that would be my

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:55.700
and I'm for this centralization. I'm against

00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:57.700
centralization and control

00:57:57.800 --> 00:57:59.900
and I'm for decentralization

00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:02.800
and the open-source period of

00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:03.300
four

00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:05.500
it if you need to if you

00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:07.500
disagree basically, which yeah,

00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:09.800
so that would be my

00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:13.500
and I know that I disagree with other people on

00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:15.900
this and but that's

00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:17.100
my point of view

00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:19.900
and we can argue about it.

00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:21.800
I have Arguments

00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:24.900
for that kind of things when we get to

00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:26.900
that when thank you. Yeah, they're

00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:29.900
infantis you we seem to have

00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:31.900
a slightly this slight

00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:33.200
disagreement as to

00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:35.900
With the database to manage whether it should be copied

00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:37.800
and copied and maintained by different people or

00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:39.800
whether it should be centralized. But

00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:41.800
that's that's part of the fun. We can talk about

00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:43.900
debuffing the general direction of travel

00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:45.900
is is correct. We need

00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:46.900
to save that data.

00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:50.100
So I've tried to limit this call to

00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:52.800
an hour. Are we doing

00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:55.700
and now I'm 35, I

00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:57.800
know and now we're 35 know

00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:59.600
it we start know. It's

00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:01.900
an hour and 10, so

00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:03.200
it's an hour and

00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:05.200
And it's been an hour and Penny almost any

00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:06.000
yeah.

00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:09.900
So yeah, there was quite a lot to talk about

00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:10.600
quite clearly.

00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:13.400
Those are real concerns for

00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:15.900
independent perfumers like ourselves.

00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:18.800
There's clearly an appetite to help resolve it.

00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:20.800
There's a lot of questions left

00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:22.800
unanswered. So

00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:25.900
the intention is for people to watch this

00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:26.300
video.

00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:29.100
I hope I didn't bore you to death.

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:32.700
I believe you're going to post it on base

00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:34.600
notes. Is that correct? Yes,

00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:36.700
and yes, it's going to be on

00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:38.700
YouTube as well or is it just no

00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:40.800
just you just bake. I don't know where I'm going to

00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:42.700
lost it yet, maybe but I don't

00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:44.500
want to again because I hate

00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:46.700
centralized things. I'm not

00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:48.600
gonna know it's not gonna be on

00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:50.200
on YouTube probably

00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:53.700
anyone watching wherever you are right now.

00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:56.800
Let us know your thoughts comment.

00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.900
Video, if you'd like to take part in

00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:01.700
these discussions, please make yourselves

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:03.800
known of course through the

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.500
Forum or Facebook or

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:07.300
wherever you're watching this video.

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.900
The intention is to have another chat in a couple

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:12.300
of weeks. Is that fair?

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.700
Yes, once we far

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:16.800
even sooner as far as I'm concerned,

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.600
I'm ready for something sooner.

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:21.900
I think we say couple of weeks just so we have a chance to absorb

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:23.100
all the information

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.900
maybe let people come and discuss it

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:26.700
watch the video.

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:29.900
and also maybe thought of actions and then

01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:31.600
we can share those publicly

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.900
will be following up some of the items mentioned during this goal

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.800
update everyone, but it's

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.900
definitely an ongoing concern

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.800
either we find a short-term solution or

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:49.900
Sir, here we are again. It looks like

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:51.500
we had technical difficulties.

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.900
So I'm doing my closing again.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.500
So those are real concerns for

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:00.700
perfumers independent perfumers, like

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:02.300
ourselves. There's

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.600
clearly an appetite to

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:06.500
help resolve the problem. The

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.800
intention is for everyone here

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.900
watching this video and

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.400
comment. Let us know your folks

01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:15.200
if you'd like to take part in these

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.000
discussions.

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:18.900
Please do make yourselves known for

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:20.400
it forum for Facebook for

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.800
YouTube. Just let us

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:24.800
know you're interested in helping

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.900
out. The intention is

01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:28.500
to have another chat in a couple of weeks.

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:31.900
Once we've had a chance to absorb this information

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:34.900
and maybe full of actions and we'll share those

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:35.500
publicly.

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:38.600
We will also be

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.700
following up on some of the items that were

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:42.000
discussed during that call.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.500
This is definitely an ongoing concern.

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.400
Either we find a short-term solution

01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:51.700
or maybe our fears will be put to

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:53.800
bed. So to speak maybe we'll get a

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.800
phone call from TGs

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.400
see telling us everything's fine.

01:01:57.700 --> 01:01:59.800
Then maybe everything is fine. But

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.700
there are so many websites that

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:03.900
are currently at risk so many

01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:05.300
databases. I'd risk

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:07.700
that. I think there's

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.100
quite a lot of work to do.

01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:12.900
So, thanks everyone.

01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:15.500
See you on the forums see on Facebook.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.500
And I'll see you on the further

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.900
video in a couple of weeks by.
